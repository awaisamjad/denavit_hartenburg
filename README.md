# Calculate Forward Kinematics via DH Parameters

## Overview

This Rust CLI tool is designed to calculate forward kinematics for robotic arms using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. Forward kinematics is a crucial step in robotics that helps determine the end-effector's position and orientation based on joint angles and DH parameters.

## Features

- Calculate forward kinematics for robotic arms with DH parameters.
- Input joint angles and DH parameters interactively via the command line.
- Receive the end-effector's position and orientation as the output.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

   ```shell
